# CS-210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- For this project, I had to write a program for a grocery store to track which items of their produce sections sold the most. 
What did you do particularly well?
- The few things that I did well where writing the code that would keep track of what items were selling
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I need to work on writing the least amout of code as possible in order to make the code more readable and less complex. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The most challening part of the code was wrtitng and displaying the code with the data of which items were the most sold. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- I hope that learnig how to write code for real buisnesses can traslate across industries to help me develope a versatile skill set. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - I tried my best to write code according to the standards provided.
